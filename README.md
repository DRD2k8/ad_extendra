<h1>Ad Extendra</h1>
Ad Extendra is an add-on mod, that adds more content to <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ad-astra">Ad Astra</a> like it didn't already have enough content. It is in beta right now and there isn't much new content available, but I'm constantly trying to improve it and add new things

<h3>Mod Support</h3>
The mod currently only supports <a href="https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.20.1.html">Forge 1.20.1</a> and depends on <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ad-astra/files/4894852">Ad Astra v1.15.5</a> exactly (any older or newer version of Ad Astra <b>will not work!</b>). It also depends on all the mods that Ad Astra depends on, which are: <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/resourceful-lib">Resourceful Lib</a>, <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/resourceful-config">Resourceful Config</a>, and <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/botarium">Botarium</a>
